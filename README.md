1. discover-IT
  A portfolio project meant to display skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and
specifically skills in asynchronous client-side app development.

2. Description 
  discover-IT allows users the ability to search through Reddit in a way that they never have before. Ever wanted 
  to find subreddits that contain content you love but never known how to find these subreddits? discover-IT will let you
  subreddits sorted by their content based on a term you search. The results that are displayed will give you each subreddit
  four sample posts from them as well as allowing access to each of the users of those posts.
  
3. UX
  The web-app is meant to extremely streamlined. I tried to avoid adding unessecary buttons or distracting features. This
  imbues the page with a certain level of intuition by default. The background picture that you first see on initial load
  lends itself to the simplistic color palette with stark solid colors.
